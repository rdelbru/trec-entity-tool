Tool for TREC Entity Track 2011

This tool is a demo for indexing and querying the Sindice dataset 2011 available
at [1]. Its purpose is to show how to extract entities from the dataset and to
index them using SIREn [2]. Some example queries are written in the JUnit tests.
The tool is composed of the following classes:
- Indexing: it takes care of creating the index;
- Sindice{ED,DE}Indexing: it extracts entities from the dataset, depending on
  the format;
- Entity: it is the class representing an Entity;
- Utils: it contains utility methods used for indexing.

The command line interface is the class org.sindice.siren.index.IndexingCLI.

To create a jar with maven:
	$ mvn assembly:assembly
this will create the jar target/siren-eostool-0.1-SNAPSHOT-assembly.jar

To run the JUnit tests with maven:
	$ mvn test

To create an index for the Sindice-ED dataset format:
	$ java -cp $JAR org.sindice.siren.index.IndexingCLI \
					--dumps-dir src/test/resources/ 	\
					--index-dir /tmp/test-ED			\
					--format SINDICE_ED
	where $JAR=target/siren-eostool-0.1-SNAPSHOT-assembly.jar
This will create an index at /tmp/test-ED from the files at src/test/resources/
corresponding to the dataset format SINDICE_ED.
